# Flower Image Classification CNN Model
## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying flower images. 

Given an input image of a flower, the model predicts the name of the flower from five categories: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, tulips.

The dataset comprises 3,700 photos of flowers.

## Dataset Description
The dataset is organized into five sub-directories, each representing a flower class:
- daisy
- dandelion
- roses
- sunflowers
- tulips

## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn gradio
   ```

3. **Download Dataset**: The dataset will be automatically downloaded when running the code from the provided Jupyter notebook.

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**: Open and run the Jupyter notebook `Flower_Classification.ipynb` to train and evaluate the CNN model.

5. **Interact with the Model**: After training the model, you can interact with it using the provided interface.

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of over 90%-95% on the validation dataset.
